CSSE280 web app that creates playlists based on a subgenre and length of time

If I was to continue working on this project, or if I had a partner/more time, the two main things I would do are:
1.) Add cross-genre support, so that users can create playlists with songs from more than one specific subgenre
2.) Give users the ability to sign in with their own* Spotify account to be able to actually save the generated playlists.

* During development, I had my own Spotify account linked and actually saved the dozens of playlists that were generated.  Before publishing this code, I decided that I would remove my account's connection.  I made that decision so that if anyone uses the web app, my Spotify account has no potential to be flooded with a bunch of playlists that are unrelated to me and I do not want.
